# Sugarbowl Contact Tracing Form 

Sugarbowl is a restaurant in Edmonton, AB, Canada. A Google Form had been created to collect customer info for COVID-19 contact tracing. Customers accessed the form by typing in an URL or scanning a QR code on their electronic device. 

When a customer submits a form, Google Forms is unable to automatically redirect customers to another website. Thus, this GitHub page was created to do just that. It redirects customers to Sugarbowl's website, which includes beverage and food menus. This means that physical menus no longer need to be used.
